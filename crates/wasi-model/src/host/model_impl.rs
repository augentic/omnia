//! The `complete` host binding (§3.4).
//!
//! This is the analogue of `wasi-keyvalue/src/host/store_impl.rs`: it implements
//! the generated `completion` host trait on [`WasiModel`]. It is the floor's
//! final gate — it applies the pre-checks (§3.1.1–§3.1.2), hands the owned prompt
//! and a per-completion [`ToolHost`] to the backend, then *re-validates* the
//! returned answer (§3.1.3) before mapping it to the guest-visible `answer`
//! string. A backend that runs its own repair loop (genai) consumes validation
//! failures internally and only returns once it passes; the floor re-gates here.
